# Brainhack

A brainf\*ck interpreter

brainf\*ck is an esoteric language that is designed to be turing-complete while remaining as minimal as possible. More information can be found at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

The current implementation is a simple REPL with no optimization. It works, but is somewhat slow at more complicated programs (like the mandelbrot set example). 

Future plans include developing opcodes to increase performance
